  	<h1>Arn</h1>
  	<p>Arn is the spherical planet located in plane #<span class="placeholder">{number}</span>. It is around four times the size of Earth and mostly covered by water. Situated in the center of a massive [shell] which is about 1 million miles away from Arn's surface. Light on Arn is provided by [the Sun] which sits stationary relative to the shell about 200 thousand miles away from the planet's surface. Arn rotates from west to east with and axial tilt of 34.7 degrees relative to the Sun. Since Arn is stationary relative to [the Sun], there are no seasons. This also means that above the arctic circle (at 55.3 degrees north) the Sun never sets and below the antarctic circle (at 55.3 degress south) the Sun never rises. Arn has two main inhabited regions which are divided by vast bodies of water. Another consequence of this is the general trend of climates to become hotter as one travels north. The Land of Men (Leoscir) contains the continents Micelard, Samorig and <span class="placeholder">{Eastern continent}</span> while the Land of Beasts (Deoscir) contains the continents <span class="placeholder">{Beastman continents}</span>. Aside from the civilizations on the surface, there are several advanced civilizations that can be found both underground and underwater.</p> 
  
  	<h3>Races of Arn</h3>
	<p>Arn is home to a variety of races, most of which can be broadly divided into two categories, men and beastfolk. Races within a category share a common origin, and in most cases can interbreed. Breeding across categories is not possible without magical intervention.</p>
